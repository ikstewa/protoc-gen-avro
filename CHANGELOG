# Changelog

# UNRELEASED

- Fix: Still seeing nested `type: { type: {} }` declarations for maps where the values are collapsed records (only for first invocation).

# 0.7.2 - 2024-02-28

- Fix: Accidentally removed map defaults, oops!

# 0.7.1 - 2024-02-27

- Revert and re-fix the issue with flattened `type` declarations.
- Stop emitting a default of `{}` for records as Avro can't actually handle this.

# 0.7 - 2024-02-27

- Fix: Union types are now flattened (i.e. if a union has a type which is another union, they will be combined).
- Feature / breaking change: add `preserve_non_string_maps` and change default behavior to turn all maps into string-keyed ones.

# 0.6.1 - 2024-02-27

- Fix: `collapse_fields` was only working on the first instance of the field, not when it was found inside a map etc. later on.

# 0.5 - 2024-02-26

- Fix: oneofs were not being emitted.
